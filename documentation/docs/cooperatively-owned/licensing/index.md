# Izzup - Licensing

Dual licensed under AGPL and `Open Co-Op` license

## Open Co-Op License

This free license option is available to accepted cooperatively owned businesses. It allows pulling changes from our `main` branch, while never having to publish `ANY` of the changes they make.

### License Fees

There are no license fees or revenue sharing requirements. The only requirement is that the licensee is one of the following:

* Co-op
* Employee owned
* Sole proprietorship
* Non-profit

ALL `Co-op License` holders must first be voted in, and must then adhere to the interoperability guidelines and specs in their commercial offerings.
